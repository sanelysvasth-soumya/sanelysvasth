                In today's health-conscious era, phrases like "weight loss" and "fat loss" are frequently used interchangeably. As per 2022 statistics, 2.5 billion adults aged 18 and above are overweight, with 890 million suffering from obesity. This accounts for 43% of adults (43% men and 44% women), a significant increase from 1990 when only 25% of adults were overweight.

            <h2>Health Risks of Overweight & Obesity</h2>
            <div class="alert-info">
                <p>
                    Excess fat deposits in the body define overweight, whereas obesity is a long-term, intricate health issue involving excessive fat that can negatively impact one's well-being. Individuals with obesity face a higher risk of developing various comorbid conditions, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD)</li>
                    <li>Gastrointestinal disorders</li>
                    <li>Type 2 diabetes (T2D)</li>
                    <li>Musculoskeletal issues</li>
                    <li>Respiratory problems</li>
                    <li>Psychological challenges</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These complications may significantly increase the risk of mortality.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Pregnant people who have obesity may have a greater chance of developing gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, needing a cesarean delivery, and taking longer to recover after giving birth. Obesity increases the likelihood of developing heartburn, gallbladder disease, and liver problems. Having a large body size may increase blood pressure because your heart needs to pump harder to supply blood to all your cells. Excess fat may also damage your kidneys, which help regulate blood pressure. High blood pressure can strain your heart, damage blood vessels, and raise your risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, and death.
            </p>

            <h3>Breathing Problems</h3>
            <p>
                If you are overweight or obese, you may have more fat stored around your neck, making the airway smaller. A smaller airway can make breathing difficult or cause snoring. Sleep apnea is a common problem when your upper airway becomes blocked, causing you to breathe irregularly or even stop breathing altogether for short periods of time. Untreated sleep apnea may raise your risk of developing many health problems, including heart disease and diabetes.
            </p>

            <h3>Asthma</h3>
            <p>
                Obesity can increase your risk of developing asthma, experiencing worse symptoms, and having a harder time managing the condition.
            </p>

            <h2>Causes for weight gain</h2>
            <p>
                Numerous factors contribute to the risk of overweight and obesity. Some are individual factors like knowledge, skills, and behaviors. Others are in your environment, such as school, workplace, and neighborhood. Additionally, food industry practices and marketing as well as social and cultural norms and values can also impact your risk. Although we may not be able to change all of your risk factors for overweight or obesity. But knowing your risk is important to help you take steps to reach a healthy weight:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Lifestyle choices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of physical activity: Insufficient exercise contributes to weight gain, as it reduces the number of calories burnt daily, leading to an energy imbalance.</li>
                <li>Unhealthy eating behaviors: Consuming more calories than required, excessive saturated fat intake, and high added sugar consumption are associated with increased risk for overweight and obesity. Low usage and processed foods lead to water weight loss because these foods often have high sodium content, which can cause water retention. Reducing their intake can help in shedding excess water weight.</li>
                <li>Inadequate sleep and High stress levels: Poor-quality or insufficient sleep can impact hormones regulating hunger, such as ghrelin and leptin, increasing the likelihood of overeating and weight gain. Both short-term and long-term stress can trigger hormonal changes, such as increased cortisol levels, which may lead to overeating and weight gain.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Genetics</h3>
            <p>
                Specific genes, such as those identified in research (15 genes influencing obesity), can predispose individuals to heavier body weights, the amount of body fat you store, and where that fat is distributed. Genetics also may play a role in how efficiently your body converts food into energy, how your body regulates your appetite and how your body burns calories during exercise. Obesity tends to run in families. That's not just because of the genes they share. Family members also tend to share similar eating and activity habits.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Diseases and medications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Medications: Some drugs, like antidepressants, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, birth control, glucocorticoids, and insulin, can cause weight gain by affecting hunger signals in the brain.</li>
                <li>Pre-existing conditions: Sometimes other medical conditions or medicines that you take may lead to overweight and obesity. Cushing's syndrome, caused by cortisol imbalance, Hypothyroidism, an inability to produce enough thyroid hormone and Polycystic ovary syndrome are some examples.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What can you do?</h2>
            <div class="alert-info">
                <ol>
                    <li>Consider taking 10 minute walk post your meals. Besides that incorporate at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 45 minutes of brisk walk per everyday. Choose activities you enjoy, such as dancing, swimming, cycling, or walking, to make exercise more enjoyable and sustainable. Additionally, physical activity can improve your mood, reduce stress levels, and enhance overall well-being.</li>
                    <li>Stress and sleep disturbances lead to hormonal imbalances, such as increased cortisol levels, which can disrupt weight loss efforts. Ensuring proper sleep and stress management is crucial for maintaining hormonal balance. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep by establishing a consistent sleep schedule and limiting exposure to screens (e.g., TV, smartphones, computers) before bedtime. Practice stress management techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga. Identify and address the root causes of stress, if possible.</li>
                    <li>Limit saturated fat intake (Processed and packaged foods) to no more than 10% of your daily calorie intake. Plan meals and snacks in advance to avoid impulsive, unhealthy food choices. Instead, opt for healthier fats like avocados, nuts, region-specific cold-pressed oils and fatty fish.</li>
                    <li>Avoid midnight snacking and practice mindful eating. Early dinners promote better sleep and reduce late-night snacking, which can contribute to weight gain. This can help prevent weight gain and improve your overall sleep quality. Consuming a lighter dinner with a focus on vegetables and lean proteins can help you maintain a calorie deficit and support healthy digestion.</li>
                    <li>Sugars found in sugary drinks, candies, and baked goods can lead to empty calories and hinder your weight loss progress. Reduce consumption of added sugar to less than 10% of your daily calorie intake. Replace sugary beverages with water, unsweetened tea, or low-calorie alternatives.</li>
                    <li>Begin your day with a nutritious and light breakfast. Eating according to the power of digestive fire (Agni in Ayurveda) ensures better digestion and absorption of nutrients, which can contribute to overall health and weight management. This sets the tone for your daily food choices and helps regulate your blood sugar levels. A light breakfast should include a balance of protein, healthy fats, and fiber can keep you feeling full and energized throughout the morning.</li>
                    <li>Including protein in every meal is essential for building and repairing muscle tissue, supporting satiety, and boosting metabolism. Consuming protein helps prevent muscle loss during weight loss, supporting overall health and maintaining a healthy metabolism. Lean meats, beans, lentils, and low-fat dairy are excellent protein sources to incorporate into your meals.</li>
                    <li>Staying hydrated is crucial for weight management, as drinking enough water throughout the day can help you feel full, support digestion, and boost your metabolism. Hydration is necessary to aid fat metabolism, as it supports various bodily functions, including digestion and nutrient absorption. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water daily to ensure you're staying hydrated.</li>
