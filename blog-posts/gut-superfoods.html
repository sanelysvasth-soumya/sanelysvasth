                "Superfoods" is a term commonly used to refer to foods that are rich in nutrients and believed to confer health benefits due to their high levels of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other beneficial compounds.
            </p>

            <h2>Yogurt and Fermented Foods</h2>
            <div class="alert-info">
                <p>
                    Protein is vital for repairing and building muscles. Greek yogurt, specifically, boasts higher protein content than regular yogurt, making it a suitable choice for athletes seeking to support muscle recovery. Yogurt contains probiotics, beneficial bacteria that foster a healthy gut microbiome. Maintaining a balanced gut microbiota is crucial for optimal digestion and nutrient absorption. It is a reliable source of calcium, essential for maintaining robust bones and preventing injuries, especially in impact sports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While not as rich in carbohydrates as some other foods, yogurt provides a quick energy source due to its natural sugars (lactose). It is a versatile food easily incorporated into various meals and snacks, whether consumed on its own, mixed with fruits, added to smoothies, or used as a base for sauces and dressings.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, and kombucha.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Bananas</h2>

                <h2>Remember</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rome wasn't built in a Day. Certain superfoods, especially those high in fiber, may cause digestive discomfort if introduced too quickly. Gradually increase your intake to allow your digestive system to adjust.</li>
                    <li>Stay hydrated, as proper hydration is crucial for gut health, impacting your performance.</li>
                    <li>To consult with a Dietitian to tailor your diet to your specific needs and training regimen.</li>
                    <li>If you are pregnant, nursing, or have specific medical conditions, seek guidance from a healthcare professional or registered dietitian before making significant dietary changes.</li>
                    <li>It's generally preferable to obtain nutrients from whole foods rather than relying solely on supplements.</li>
                    <li>Even healthy foods should be consumed in moderation. Excessive intake of certain nutrients or compounds may have unintended effects.</li>
                </ul>
