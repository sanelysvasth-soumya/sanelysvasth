                Calcium, a vital mineral, plays a significant role in maintaining our overall health and well-being. It is well-known for its contribution to bone strength, but its importance extends far beyond that.
            </p>

            <h2>The Importance of Calcium in Human Health</h2>
            
            <div class="alert-info">
                <h3>Key Functions of Calcium:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bone Health: Calcium is essential for building and maintaining strong bones. It is a key component of bone tissue, providing structure and rigidity. Adequate calcium intake helps prevent osteoporosis, a condition characterized by weak and brittle bones that can lead to fractures and stunted growth in children.</li>
                    <li>Muscle Function: Calcium plays a crucial role in muscle contractions, including those of the heart. It enables the release of energy from cells, allowing muscles to function efficiently. A calcium deficiency can lead to muscle weakness, cramps, and even tetany – a condition characterized by continuous muscle contractions.</li>
                    <li>Nervous System: Calcium is vital for the proper functioning of the nervous system. It aids in the transmission of nerve impulses and helps maintain the electrical charge within cells. This ensures that our brain and nervous system can communicate effectively, impacting our overall cognitive function and mental health.</li>
                    <li>Blood Clotting: Calcium is involved in the blood clotting process, which is essential for preventing excessive blood loss in case of injury. It activates certain proteins that help form blood clots, allowing our body to heal effectively.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                Calcium significantly impacts sports performance by promoting bone injury prevention, optimizing muscle function, supporting the nervous system, and enhancing recovery. Adequate calcium intake helps athletes maintain strong bones, generate force, reduce fatigue, improve reaction times and balance, and speed up injury healing.
            </p>
